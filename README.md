# TO DO LIST

## Description

_Duration: ~12 hours_

This is a website that acts as a To Do List. You can add any task you would like, a description for it, and a date to be done by. 

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app` in postgreSQL. once the database is made, copy the data from the database.sql file and paste it into your SQL Query. this should create a table and some dummy data. 
2. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install` in the terminal. you will need node.js installed for this to work
3. Run `npm start` in your terminal, this should start the application
4. Go to `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser of choice


## Usage

1. Enter in a Task that will eventually need to be done
2. Enter in the description for the task and the date youd like it to be done by
3. When the task is finished, you can click the "Complete" button, this will provide a visual representation of what has been completed, this button is even togglable, so if you accidently click it, you can switch between complete and not complete
4. When you no longer want a task on the list at all, you can simply press the delete button.
